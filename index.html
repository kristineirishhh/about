                    <p>African Swine Fever (ASF) is a highly contagious, generalized disease of pigs caused by an Iridovirus of the family Asfarviridae that exhibits varying virulence between strains and is very hardy to physical and chemical inactivation (Food and Agriculture Organization, 2021). This disease resembles classical swine fever (CSF) or hog cholera, laboratory tests are essential to identify the difference between the two diseases (The Pig Site, 2021). The virus causing the disease is different from the CSF virus, and only infects domestic and wild pigs, as well ticks of the genus Ornithodoros (World Organisation for Animal Health, 2021). These soft-bodied, eyeless ticks called "tampans," serve as natural hosts for the ASF virus (ASFV). ASFV is then transmitted through these tick bites.  Fortunately, this virus is not contagious to humans. Lam (2019), in her report, affirmed that ASF is not considered a food safety issue.
